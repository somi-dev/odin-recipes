<p> This hot dog is a Windy City classic and a big favorite with sports fans! The frank must be all-beef, the bun must
    be poppy seed, and the ingredients must be piled onto the bun in the order specified. And whatever you do, don't
    spoil the splendor of this Chicago dog with ketchup!</p>

    <li> Place hot dog in steamed bun. Pile on toppings in this order: mustard, relish, onion, tomato, pickle, peppers,
        and celery salt. The tomato wedges should be nestled between hot dog and top of bun on one side. Place pickle
        between hot dog and bottom of bun on the other side. Don't even think about ketchup! </li>
